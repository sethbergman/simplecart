It goes without saying that we're constantly refactoring, even things that are functionally done. We do not recommend using for production usage yet, unless you are very comfortable with the code, and aren't risk averse. There are still many parts in development!\r\n\r\nThe Docker image is automatically built at the [Ongo Works public Docker repo](https://index.docker.io/u/ongoworks/), on any `master` repository changes. We're working on functionality to allow selectable Reaction/Docker images in the future.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\nNode.js and NPM are required. Install from http://nodejs.org/\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install Meteor + Reaction, and start the latest release:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh\r\ngit clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction.git\r\ncd reaction && git checkout master\r\nmeteor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also an executable [script that you run](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/blob/development/bin/install). Additional installation options are in the [developer documentation](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-core/blob/development/docs/installation.md).\r\n\r\n_Note: for windows installation you also need:_\r\n- OpenSSL\r\n- Visual Studio 2008 redistributables\r\n- Git + mysgit\r\n- ImageMagick\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\n\r\nAs with all development, some items are ahead of schedule, and some are not. Here's how to get the details:\r\n\r\nFor a high level review our roadmap, take a look at the vision page [Reaction Vision](http://reactioncommerce.com/vision)\r\n\r\nFor grouping of development channels by feature see project milestones: [https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/milestones](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/milestones)\r\n\r\nAnd finally for the kanban-esque, hardcore real time progress view, take a look our [waffle board](https://waffle.io/reactioncommerce/reaction)\r\n\r\n##Developer Documentation\r\n\r\n[Getting started guide](http://thoughts.reactioncommerce.com/how-to-get-involved-with-reaction-commerce/)\r\n\r\n[Installation](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/installation.md)\r\n\r\n[Guidelines](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/conventions.md)\r\n\r\n[Methods](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/methods.md)\r\n\r\n[Package Development](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/packages.md)\r\n\r\n[Theme Development](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/themes.md)\r\n\r\n[i18n Translations](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/i18n.md)\r\n\r\n[Template Development](https://github.com/ongoworks/reaction-core/blob/master/docs/templates.md)\r\n\r\n###Code Repositories\r\n\r\nHey!
